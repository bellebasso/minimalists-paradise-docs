Automatically hides multiple UI elements, including the tab bar, ribbon, status bar, sidepane headers, and vault profile â€” for a cleaner, distraction-free workspace. These elements smoothly reveal themselves when hovered, allowing you to keep a minimalist layout without sacrificing quick navigation.

> This feature is fully optional and highly customizable: each UI element (tabs, ribbon, status bar, tab title bar, header icons in side pane and vault profile) can be toggled individually to suit your preferred level of minimalism.

> [!info] **WARNING:**
> This feature is still a work in progress, if you encounter any bugs or inconsistencies please open an [issue](https://github.com/bellebasso/Minimalists-Paradise/issues).
> > This feature has presented some inconsistencies when used with the plugin [Typewriter Mode](https://github.com/davisriedel/obsidian-typewriter-mode). I've tried correcting it (still a work in progress), but nothing seemed to solve it. If you rely on that plugin for your workflow but still wants to use [[Minimalist's Paradise\|Minimalist's Paradise]] and this feature, check out this [open source alternative](https://github.com/coignard/obsidian-scroller)! It has basically all the same functionalities from [Typewriter Mode](https://github.com/davisriedel/obsidian-typewriter-mode), but it doesn't present any visual inconsistencies.
