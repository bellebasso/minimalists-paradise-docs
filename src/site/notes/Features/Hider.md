Automatically hides multiple UI elements, including the tab bar, ribbon, status bar, sidepane headers, and vault profile — for a cleaner, distraction-free workspace. These elements smoothly reveal themselves when hovered, allowing you to keep a minimalist layout without sacrificing quick navigation.

> This feature is fully optional and highly customizable: each UI element (tabs, ribbon, status bar, tab title bar, header icons in side pane and vault profile) can be toggled individually to suit your preferred level of minimalism.
