Automatically hides multiple UI elements, including the tab bar, ribbon, status bar, sidepane headers, and vault profile â€” for a cleaner, distraction-free workspace. These elements smoothly reveal themselves when hovered, allowing you to keep a minimalist layout without sacrificing quick navigation.

> This feature is fully optional and highly customizable: each UI element (tabs, ribbon, status bar, tab title bar, header icons in side pane and vault profile) can be toggled individually to suit your preferred level of minimalism.

> [!info] **WARNING:**
> This feature is still a work in progress, there are some bugs associated with it, but nothing system breaking. A known issue is the vertical spacing of tabs changing when switching from one tab to another.
