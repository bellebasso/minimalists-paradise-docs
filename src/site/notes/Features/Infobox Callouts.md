Make your notes aesthetic and interactive with the infobox callouts (inspired by and adapted from [this snippet](https://github.com/Avyrra/Infobox-Callouts?tab=readme-ov-file)).

> This is integrated to use the theme colors. If you prefer to use the original snippet with all the customization features, disable the infobox section via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
# How to use?
Most markdown format supported by obsidian is supported (refer to the original [snippet](https://github.com/Avyrra/Infobox-Callouts?tab=readme-ov-file) repo for more details).
```markdown
