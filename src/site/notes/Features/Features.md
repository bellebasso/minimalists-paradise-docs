# [[Features/Extended Color Schemes\|Extended Color Schemes]]
Minimalist's Paradise is minimal, but not boring. Sick of the plain black or grey? Choose between multiple color schemes to find the one which better suit your needs via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings). (This looks even better with the [Color Accent Override](Color%20Accent%20Override.md) turned on!)
# [[Features/Color Accent Override\|Color Accent Override]]
Does your color accent look perfect in dark mode, but not that good in light mode? With Minimalist's Paradise you can choose between using the vanilla color accent or assigning different colors and tones per theme. This way your theme will always look it's best.
# [[Features/Colored Headers\|Colored Headers]]
Give your notes a little color with the colored headers! Choose between different presets or create your own custom combinations.
# [[Features/Infobox Callouts\|Infobox Callouts]]
Make your notes aesthetic and interactive with the infobox callouts (inspired by and adapted from [this snippet](https://github.com/Avyrra/Infobox-Callouts?tab=readme-ov-file)).
> This is integrated to use the theme colors. If you prefer to use the original snippet with all the customization features, disable the infobox section via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
# [[Features/Tabbed Callouts\|Tabbed Callouts]]
Create callouts with tabs for better navigation (inspired by and adapted from [this snippet](https://github.com/r-u-s-h-i-k-e-s-h/Obsidian-CSS-Snippets/blob/Collection/Snippets/Callout%20styling%20-%20Tabbed%20callout.md)).

> This is integrated to use the theme colors. If you prefer to use the original snippet, disable the tabbed callout section via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
# [[Features/Hover Properties\|Hover Properties]]
For an even more minimalist look, enable the setting [[Features/Hover Properties\|Hover Properties]] to automatically hide the properties and reveal them by simply hovering.
# [[Features/Hider\|Hider]]
Automatically hides multiple UI elements, including the tab bar, ribbon, status bar, sidepane headers, and vault profile — for a cleaner, distraction-free workspace. These elements smoothly reveal themselves when hovered, allowing you to keep a minimalist layout without sacrificing quick navigation.
