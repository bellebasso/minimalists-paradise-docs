Does your color accent look perfect in dark mode, but not that good in light mode? With Minimalist's Paradise you can choose between using the vanilla color accent or assigning different colors and tones per theme. This way your theme will always be it's best.

> This setting works in a light mode/dark mode basis and is particularly useful for the [Extended Color Schemes](Extended%20Color%20Schemes.md). There are a lot of things that rely on the color accent (such as table headers, active tabs, citations, highlights, all types of links and more). Therefore, it is recommended to keep this setting on for a better visual, specially regarding the [Extended Color Schemes](Extended%20Color%20Schemes.md).
