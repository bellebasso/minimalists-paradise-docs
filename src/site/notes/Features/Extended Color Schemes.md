Minimalist's Paradise is minimal, but not boring. Choose between different presets for both light and dark mode, in an integrated interface via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. (This looks even better with the Color Accent Override turned on!)

> **Disclaimer**: ALL extended color schemes showcases have both the enable [[Features/Colored Headers\|colored headers]] and the [[Features/Color Accent Override\|color accent override]] settings turned on.
